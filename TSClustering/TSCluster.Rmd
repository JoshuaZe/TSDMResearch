## Quick Literature Review

**Clustering of time series data - a survey** provided an overview of time-series-clustering, and then grouped into three major methods.
- raw-data-based approaches (high dimension spaces)
- feature-based approaches (manual feature and dimension reduction methods)
- model-based approaches

## Including Research Code and Data

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r Time-Series-Clustering}
load("../data/hs300.RData")
source("TSClustering.R")
```
